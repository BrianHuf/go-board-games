# GO-BOARD-GAMES
Abstract board game engine

Hobby project.  
This is probably my tenth time writing this.
Each time, I've chosen a different technology stack.

This time, Go is the new language for me to learn.

# Objective
Create an AI to play Siam (my favorite board game).

## Implementation Plan (wish list)
- generic game engine
- tic-tac-toe
- play via cli
- mcts with random playout & multi-threads
- siam
- play via browser (probably React JS)
- ui to visualize mcts tree
- augment mcts with machine learning
